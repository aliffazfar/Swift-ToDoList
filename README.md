#  To-Do List App Development with Swift and Firebase Authentication

##Introduction
In this project, I am learning to develop a To-Do List application using the Swift programming language, 
along with Firebase Authentication for user management and document-based storage.

##Technologies Used
- Swift: A powerful and intuitive programming language used for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS app development.
- Firebase: A comprehensive platform provided by Google that offers a variety of backend services, including authentication and real-time database capabilities.
- Firebase Authentication: Part of the Firebase suite, it provides a simple and secure way to authenticate and manage users in your application.
- Document-Based Storage: This approach allows users to create, edit, and manage documents (in this case, to-do list items) within the application.

##Project Goals
The main objectives of this project are as follows:
- Develop a user-friendly To-Do List app with a clean and intuitive interface.
- Implement Firebase Authentication to enable user registration, login, and secure access to the app's features.
- Utilize Firebase's real-time database capabilities to store and sync the user's to-do list data across devices.
- Employ document-based storage to allow users to create, edit, and manage their to-do list items efficiently.
